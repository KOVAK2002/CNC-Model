# CNC-Model
Using ML we can detect sharp vs dull tool
CNC Machine Sound Classification
This project aims to classify the sounds produced by a CNC machine into three categories: Normal Background, Sharp Tool, and Dull Tool, using machine learning techniques. It involves audio preprocessing, feature extraction using MFCC (Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients), training a neural network, and deploying the model on devices with limited resources like a Raspberry Pi.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a system that can automatically classify the operational sound of CNC machines. By detecting abnormal sounds (such as a dull tool), the system can alert operators for maintenance, thereby reducing downtime and increasing production efficiency.

Key features of the project include:

Preprocessing audio files for better feature extraction.
Feature extraction using MFCC, which captures key information about the sound.
Training a machine learning model (Neural Network and Logistic Regression).
Deploying the model for real-time sound classification on devices with limited resources, such as Raspberry Pi.
Technologies Used
Python 3.x
Librosa for audio processing and feature extraction.
TensorFlow/Keras for training and deploying the neural network.
Scikit-learn for logistic regression and evaluation.
Sounddevice for real-time audio recording.
Raspberry Pi for model deployment.
Installation
To set up the project on your local machine or Raspberry Pi, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:


git clone https://github.com/your-repo/cnc-sound-classification.git
cd cnc-sound-classification

Install required dependencies:


pip install numpy tensorflow librosa soundfile scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn sounddevice
(Optional) If you are using Raspberry Pi, ensure you have FFmpeg installed:

sudo apt install ffmpeg
Data Preprocessing
To preprocess the raw audio files, use the data_preprocessing.py script. This script normalizes the audio and segments it into 1-second chunks.

python data_preprocessing.py
Parameters:
Input directory: raw_audio/
Output directory: preprocessed_audio/
The output will be normalized and segmented audio files saved in the preprocessed_audio/ directory.

Feature Extraction
For feature extraction, use the feature_extraction.py script, which extracts MFCC features from the preprocessed audio files.


python feature_extraction.py
The features will be saved in features_multiclass.npz for further use in model training.

Model Training
To train the machine learning model (neural network or logistic regression), run the model_training.py script.


python model_training.py
This script will:

Load the extracted MFCC features.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Train a neural network model.
Save the trained model as cnc_sound_model_multiclass.h5.
Model Architecture
Input: MFCC features
Hidden Layers: Dense layers with ReLU activation and dropout for regularization.
Output Layer: Softmax for multiclass classification (Normal, Sharp Tool, Dull Tool).
Model Evaluation
After training, you can evaluate the model's performance using the model_evaluation.py script.


python model_evaluation.py
This script will:

Load the test dataset and the trained model.
Generate a classification report showing precision, recall, and F1-score.
Display a confusion matrix to analyze the modelâ€™s accuracy for each class.
Deploying the Model
To deploy the trained model in real-time for classifying CNC machine sounds, use the deploy_model.py script.


python deploy_model.py
This script:

Continuously listens for sound using a microphone.
Extracts MFCC features from the recorded audio.
Classifies the sound into one of the three categories: Normal Background, Sharp Tool, or Dull Tool.
Displays the classification results in real-time.
For Raspberry Pi, ensure that the microphone is properly configured and detected.

Future Improvements
Optimization for Raspberry Pi: The current model might be computationally intensive for Raspberry Pi, so TensorFlow Lite or model pruning can be applied for better performance.
Additional Classes: Introduce more classes such as "Overheated Tool" or "Loose Component" to improve predictive maintenance.
Data Augmentation: Improve the robustness of the model by adding more varied data, such as different CNC machines or operating environments.
